Hi there 👋, I'm a quantitative researcher and applied mathematician with experience in large-scale data modeling, predictive analytics, and machine learning.

On GitHub you'll mostly find projects related to:
- deep learning and representation learning for time series and text,
- probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference,
- machine learning for financial and economic data (forecasting, risk modeling, NLP for markets),
- general-purpose data science and research tooling in Python and C++.

**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, SQL, C++, LaTeX  
**Interests:** machine learning, deep learning, NLP, time-series modeling, quantitative finance, data-centric AI, and applied statistics

🧠 Check out my ongoing project: the **Quant Strategies Lab**, where I design, calibrate, and backtest systematic trading strategies, then publish interactive results and visualizations on the dashboard: [Quant Strategies Lab](https://adeladrai.github.io/quant-strategies-lab/)
